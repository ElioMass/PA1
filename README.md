Here you can find the files for the 2 first taks.
First here is the explanation of the files for the first task :

1)
At the beginning of both files there is the SRFLP instance that is used to make the calculation and both file return the result of the parralel search so the best permutation and it's cost if you run them. 
The file 1st_task.py is the file in which I used brute force and 1st_task_bab.py is the file for Branch and Bound.

2)
For the second task there is the 2nd_task.py file and the mnist_test that is used in the python file.
There is also a pdf that gives a feed back on the second task.
Also if you want to run the code and test to plot some clusters what I did is that on my Vscode environement I run the code in  ab interactive environement with the command:
 python -i second_task.py     in the terminal.
Then this allows me to call the plot function plot_clusters(pixels_np, rpz, 968) and plot the cluster you want to see ( here 968 ).
